The objectives of this data analytics project is to develop an interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with valuable insights into customer profiles, spending trends, credit risks, and transaction errors. This dashboard will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer engagement, and optimize risk management strategies effectively.
## Key Questions
1. What is the demographic composition of our customers in terms of gender, age group, income level, credit score, and debt levels?
2. Which transaction categories do our customers spend the most on?
3. Which regions account for the highest customer spending?
4. How do transaction volumes vary across our card network partners (Mastercard, Visa, Discover, and American Express)?
5. Which card network experiences the highest rate of failed transactions?
6. What are the primary reasons behind transaction errors?
## Data Collection
A **raw CSV files** with over **150,000** records spanning the period from **2022 to 2024** was provided. The dataset included key attributes such as **dim_cards_data**, **dim_users_data**, **calendar**, **dim_mcc_codes**, and **fact_transactions_data**. The data was extracted from the folder and imported into **Power Query**, where it underwent thorough cleaning and transformation.
## Data Cleaning & Preparation in Power Query
### Steps taken:
1. **Duplicate Removal:** some of the data contained duplicates which were eliminated
2. **Replacing value:** replaced some data fields due to spelling errors to ensure data integrity
3. **Change Data type:** applied the right data types for each of the columns in the table
4. **Custom columns:** created custom columns for more detailed analysis
45. ### Outcome:
Cleaned and structured data, ready for analysis and visualization

## Data Modeling
Established relationship between key tables: **dimension tables** and the **facts tables** as seen below:

![](model.PNG)

The data model is a **star schema**. There are **4 dimension tables** and **1 fact table**. The dimension tables are all joined to the fact tables on a **one-to-many relationship**.

## DAX measures
Some of the DAX measures that were created are:
```dax
Number of  Transactions = DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_transactions_data[id])

Debt-to-income ratio = [total debt]/[total yearly income] * 100

Mastercard Transaction Amount = CALCULATE([Total Transaction Amount], dim_cards_data[card_brand] = "Mastercard")
```
## Visualization and Analysis
The analysis was divided into **4 dashboard pages**, with each pages targeting specific insights. You can interact with the report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/f71368f4-bd06-44a3-9d9b-0613ef1e9770/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)
